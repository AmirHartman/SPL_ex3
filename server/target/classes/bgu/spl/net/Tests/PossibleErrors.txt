General errors:
1. message doesn't end with a null char - message header: "no null char at the end of the frame"
2. the body of a frame should be empty but isnt - "body isn't empty" (for all except SEND)
3. incorrect number of headers - "number of headers is invalid": 
    CONNECT - 5
    DISCONNECT - 1
    SEND - 2
    SUBSCRIBE - 3
    UNSUBSCRIBE - 2
4. one of more header names is invalid - "invalid one or more header names"
5. receipt id is not an integer (triggered by the failure of Integer.parseInt({input})) - "receipt id is not an integer"

CONNECT errors
1. "Wrong host" - host isn't "stomp.cs.bgu.ac.il"
2. "Wrong version" - version isnt 1.2
3. "The client is already logged in, log out before trying again" - not completely sure but i think you implement this error (socket wise)
4. "User already logged in" - username already exists and conncted to the server
5. "Wrong password" - username existes connected in thepast with a different password

DISCONNECT errors:
1. "please login first" - i didnt implement this! i think the implementation is in the client side but im not sure

SUBSCRIBE errors:
1. "Unconnected user is trying to subscribe to a channel"
2. "already subscribed to " + {destination}
3. "subscription id is not an integer" - like receipt id, triggered by Integer.parseInt

UNSUBSCRIBE errors:
1. "Unconnected user is trying to unsubscribe from a channel"
2. "user is not subscribed to channel"
3. "subscription id is not an integer" - like receipt id, triggered by Integer.parseInt

SEND errors:
1. "Unconnected user is trying to send a message"
2. "channel does not exist"
3. "user is not subscribed to channel"
4. "no body in the frame" - instead of "body isn't empty" - body should never be empty


PAY ATTENTION - errors i didnt implement but should happen:
1. "The client is already logged in, log out before trying again" - the client is already logged in (the client itself not the user name, the socket is unavalable")
2. "please login first" - triggered after a disconnect request from the terminal



in orderto run:
mvn compile
tpc:
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="bgu.spl.net.impl.stomp.StompServer" -Dexec.args="8888 tpc"
rector:
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="bgu.spl.net.impl.stomp.StompServer" -Dexec.args="7777 reactor"






bugs - tpc
1. send doesnt work well
2. logout - everything works, but need to try complex tests
3. after send is operating correctly, test report and summery again
4. everything else works perfectly

bugs - reactor
1. login, works only when everything is correct - doent work for wrong password and user already logged in (not from the same terminal) - DEADLOCK!
2. logged our - seems to work fine but eas only tested for true tests, no negative tests yet (very minimal true tests)
3. the rest of the commands were not yet tested
