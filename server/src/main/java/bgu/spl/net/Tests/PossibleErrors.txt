full information:
server is written in java and the client is written in c++.
to run the program regularly, no debugging this is what i need to write in the terminal:

step 1: compile and open the server and the client:
for client (path: root@0d9faf9d32b5:/workspaces/SPL_ex3)
cd ./client
make
./bin/StompEMIClient

server:
cd ./server
mvn compile
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="bgu.spl.net.impl.stomp.StompServer" -Dexec.args="7777 reactor"

step 2: command in the terminal to test the actual program
login 127.0.0.1 7777 yam 123 // login command
join police // subscribe to channel police
report {file_path} // sends the events in the json file that the path was given to

what should happen:
lets say clients dan, jay and ben are subscribed to channel police. dan reports (report command) on a few events to channel police. both jay and dan should recieve those reports as message frames

problem: dan sends the reports sucessfullt but ben and jay dont recieve them.
